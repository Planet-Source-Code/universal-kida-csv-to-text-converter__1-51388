Title: CSV to Text File Converter.
Description:  I thought of sharing this program with you all. Converting CSV files to Text Files as per customisation required. I was using this small project to convert the CSV file i have into different text files. The name of the text file use to be the same as the first column in the csv. Rest all corresponding data goes to the subsequent files and gets append to it.

For Example : when i run three different CSV's then all the for the first column named "UNIVERSAL" gets logged into one text file named UNIVERSAL.txt.... similar others data are getting appended.
